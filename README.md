# BLACKJACK USING JAVASCRIPT
Objective of the project was to learn javascipt.

# ABOUT GAME
I made this project only for the purpose to learn javascipt and yes making a "blackjack game" in javascipt is a bad idea.

# TECHNOLOGY
-javascript <br>
-bootstrap

# PAGES
There is only one "index.html" page. But it has more than 40 functions which perform in a syncronized manner to make the game run smooth.<br>
I have distinguish the functions into 7 types namely game functions, supporting functions, getters, setters,disable, display and winning.

<strong><h3>Game functions</h3></strong>The most important functions which helps the program to run the game.<br><br>
<strong><i>loadGame</i></strong>- it genrate 52 cards and shuffule it. and after that it deals the first card to the user and second card to himself and then tird to the user agian. <br>
<strong><i>hit</i></strong>- As soon as the user click hit. the dealer deals a card to user.<br>
<strong><i>stand</i></strong>- As soon as the user click stand the dealer stops dealing card to user and deal card to himself<br>
<strong><i>double</i></strong>- This is nothing buut a senario when user perfoms hit function and then stand with doubling the winning<br>
<strong><i>newGame</i></strong>- Use to load a new game<br>

<strong><h3>Supporting functions</h3></strong>The second most important type of functions which indirectly helps the program to execute. <br><br>
<strong><i>cardValue</i></strong>- it returns the value of the card<br>
<strong><i>checkOutput</i></strong>- Return who is winning<br>
<strong><i>checkIfBurst</i></strong>- Check if the user is busted.<br>
<strong><i>checkForBlackJack</i></strong>- Check if its  a balckjack.<br>
<strong><i>getImage</i></strong>- Get the cards image to dispyed<br>
<strong><i>checkifAuser</i></strong>- check if the user is having ace.(because it has 2 values 1 or 11)<br>
<strong><i>checkifthisisaceUser</i></strong>- check if a card is ace<br>
<strong><i>checkifthisisaceDealer</i></strong>-check if a card is ace<br>
<strong><i>shuffle</i></strong>- Shuffle the card<br>

<strong><h3>Getters and setters</h3></strong>As the name suggest it use to get a vaue or set a value<br>

<strong><h3>Disable</h3></strong>It is use to disable buttons when the game is concluded <br>

<strong><h3>Display</h3></strong>-It is use to display score<br>

<strong><h3>Winning</h3></strong>-Display stuff depending who won<br>
